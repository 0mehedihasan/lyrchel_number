# lychrel_number

A [Lychrel number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number/) is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. This process is sometimes called the 196-algorithm, after the most famous number associated with the process.

The code is made in order to iterate the algorithm and check for palindrome.
Check the code and run it. There is also a code written in comment to increase the recusion limit. BEWARE not to open the run the code.
Run it at your own risk.
